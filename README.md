# weatherCLI

This is a weather CLI I had to do for a school project.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To install this CLI you just have to clone the repository where you want it

```
https://github.com/Antostef/weatherCLI.git
```

Using the ```cd``` command you then go into the directory

and with the command

```
npm install
```

you will have fully installed this CLI

## Running the tests 

The index.js has a shebang so you can do

```
./index.js -h
```

to see the available command.

### Simple command execution

Using 

```
./index.js -t
```
You will get this prompt :

if you say no to third question this option will act as if it was --meteo

### Have fun :)
